## Description
A 2d side-scrolling question game. When the player meets an NPC it asks a question and if you get three questions right you win the game.

In the future it should be possible to add your own questions and answers but it doesn't work right now.

## How to install and use
Install Slick2D and LWJGL-2.9.3 java libraries, (LWJGL-3 might work but we had some issues so we would recommend using 2.9.3 since it is confirmed to work!
